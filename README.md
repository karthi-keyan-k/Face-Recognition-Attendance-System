# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System
Face Recognition Attendance System using python



For storing the attendance we need to create an excel named attendance.
After scanning the image it should compare with database for that purpose we need to create a folder named dataset_dir inside that folder again create another folder person_dir in that need to save required images to be scanned.  

Happy coding!!
